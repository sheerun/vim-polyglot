Vim syntax and language settings for RAML

About
---
vim-raml is a superset of Vim's own syntax settings for YAML, as RAML itself
is a superset of YAML. Obviously, filetype detection is provided for RAML
files as well to make use of the expanded syntax, as well language formatting
defaults.

You'll notice several changes over using the default YAML syntax file:
 - The RAML version header, manditory in RAML now stands out brightly,
   rather than looking like a comment.
 - Parameter interpolation i.e. ```<<thing>>``` is highlighted inside of blocks
   and values.
 - Delimiters and blocks i.e. ```-, |, etc``` are consistently highlighted
   (flaky in YAML).
 - HTTP verbs, response codes, data types, and route definitions are all
   colored separately from regular keys to help immediately distingush
   different levels of the data structure.
   - HTTP verbs include all that are supported by RAML: get, post, put, delete,
     head, patch, and options
   - Response codes e.g. 200, 201, 404, 401, etc are colored like numbers
     (for obvious reasons)
   - Data types e.g. ```type: integer```. Supports all RAML datatypes. string,
     number, integer, date, boolean, and file.
   - Route definitions: these include ```/posts:``` or ```/{id}:```

Installation
---
vim-raml doesn't have any strange or esoteric requirements.
Provided you're using Vundle, Pathogen or any of the other standard Vim
plugin managers. You can install vim-raml exactly how you'd expect.

For completeness, to install via Vundle just add the following into your
.vimrc with your other plugins

Plugin '.../.../'
Plugin 'IN3D/vim-raml'
Plugin '.../.../'

Then run:

:source %
:PluginInstall


Or for Pathogen:

cd ~/.vim/bundle
git clone https://github.com/IN3D/vim-raml.git

And Pathogen should pick it up the next time Vim is started.
