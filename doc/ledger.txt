USAGE                                                           *ledger-usage*

Copy each file to the corresponding directory in your ~/.vim directory or
install using Pathogen.

You can also use a modeline like this in every ledger file:

    vim:filetype=ledger

TIPS                                                             *ledger-tips*

Tips and useful commands

* vim-ledger can do syntax-sensitive folding when you set `foldmethod=syntax`
  in the |modeline| of your ledger file. This way transactions can shrink down
  to just one line.

* Try account-completion (as explained below). If you use YouCompleteMe, you
  should disable it for Ledger files. Put this in your .vimrc:

        if exists('g:ycm_filetype_blacklist')
          call extend(g:ycm_filetype_blacklist, { 'ledger': 1 })
        endif

* You may use `:make` for syntax checking. It may be convenient to define a
  mapping for the following command:

	:silent make | redraw! | cwindow

  It is recommended to set the value of `g:ledger_extra_options` (see below)
  as follows:

        let g:ledger_extra_options = '--pedantic --explicit --check-payees'

  to catch most potential problems in your source file.

* Remap vim paragraph motion to move by transaction.

  In vim, the "{" and "}" keystrokes move the cursor up and down by whole
  paragraphs. They can be redefined in ledger files to move by transaction
  instead. Add these lines to .vimrc:

        au FileType ledger noremap { ?^\d<CR>
        au FileType ledger noremap } /^\d<CR>

  The default definitions already work in ledger files that separate
  transactions with blank lines.

* `:call ledger#transaction_date_set(line('.'), "auxiliary")`

  will set today's date as the auxiliary date of the current transaction. You
  can use also "primary" or "unshift" in place of "auxiliary". When you pass
  "unshift" the old primary date will be set as the auxiliary date and today's
  date will be set as the new primary date.
  To use a different date pass a date measured in seconds since 1st Jan 1970
  as the third argument.

* `:call ledger#transaction_state_set(line('.'), '*')`

  sets the state of the current transaction to '*'. You can use this in custom
  mappings.

* `:call ledger#transaction_state_toggle(line('.'), ' *?!')`

  will toggle through the provided transaction states. You can map this to
  double-clicking for example:

        noremap <silent><buffer> <2-LeftMouse>\
        :call ledger#transaction_state_toggle(line('.'), ' *?!')<CR>

* `:LedgerAlign`

  moves the amount expression of a posting so that the decimal separator is
  aligned at the column specified by g:ledger_align_at. If an amount has no
  decimal point, the imaginary decimal point to the right of the least
  significant digit will align. The command acts on a range, with the default
  being the current line.

  The decimal separator can be set using `g:ledger_decimal_sep`. The default
  value of `g:ledger_decimal_sep` is `'.'`.

  See below for the recommended mappings.

* `:call ledger#align_amount_at_cursor()`

  aligns the amount under the cursor and append/prepend the default currency.
  The default currency can be set using `g:ledger_default_commodity`. Whether
  the commodity should be inserted before the amount or appended to it can be
  configured with the boolean flag `g:ledger_commodity_before` (the default
  value is 1). A separator between the commodity and the amount may be set
  using `g:ledger_commodity_sep`.

  See below for the recommended mappings.

* `:call ledger#autocomplete_and_align()`

  when the cursor is on a number or immediately after it, invokes
  `ledger#align_amount_at_cursor()` to align it and add the default currency;
  otherwise, performs autocompletion. If you define the following mappings in
  your `.vimrc` then you may perform both autocompletion and alignment using
  the <Tab> key:

        au FileType ledger inoremap <silent> <Tab> \
        <C-r>=ledger#autocomplete_and_align()<CR>
        au FileType ledger vnoremap <silent> <Tab> :LedgerAlign<CR>

  Alternatively, you may create a file `.vim/after/ftplugin/ledger.vim`
  containing the following definitions:

        inoremap <silent> <buffer> <Tab> \
        <C-r>=ledger#autocomplete_and_align()<CR>
        vnoremap <silent> <buffer> <Tab> :LedgerAlign<CR>

  Now, you may type `asset:check<Tab><Space>123.45<Tab>`, and have the
  account name autocompleted and `$123.45` properly aligned (assuming your
  default commodity is set to `'$'`). Or you may press <Tab> in Visual mode
  to align a number of transactions at once.

* `:call ledger#entry()`

  enters a new transaction based on the text in the current line.
  The text in the current line is replaced by the new transaction.
  This is a front end to `ledger entry`.

==============================================================================
REPORTS                                                      *ledger-reports*

* `:Ledger`

  Executes an arbitrary Ledger command and sends the output to a new buffer.
  For example:

        :Ledger bal ^assets ^liab

  Errors are displayed in a quickfix window. The command offers account and
  payee autocompletion (by pressing <Tab>): every name starting with `@` is
  autocompleted as a payee; any other name is autocompleted as an account.

  In a report buffer or in the quickfix window, you may press <Tab> to switch
  back to your source file, and you may press `q` to dismiss the current window.

  There are three highlight groups that are used to color the report:

  * `LedgerNumber`

    This is used to color nonnegative numbers.

  * `LedgerNegativeNumber`

    This is used to color negative numbers.

  * `LedgerImproperPerc`

    This is used to color improper percentages.

* `:Balance`

  Show the pending and cleared balance of a given account below the status
  line. For example:

	:Balance checking:savings

  The command offers payee and account autocompletion (see `:Ledger`). The
  account argument is optional: if no argument is given, the first account
  name found in the current line is used.

  Two highlight groups can be used to customize the colors of the line:

  * `LedgerCleared`

    This is used to color the cleared balance.

  * `LedgerPending`

    This is used to color the pending balance.

* `:Register`

  Opens an arbitrary register report in the quickfix window. For example:

	:Register groceries -p 'this month'

  The command offers account and payee autocompletion (see |:Ledger|). You
  may use the standard quickfix commands to jump from an entry in the register
  report to the corresponding location in the source file. If you use GUI Vim
  or if your terminal has support for the mouse (e.g., iTerm2, or even
  Terminal.app in OS X 10.11 or later), you may also double-click on a line
  number in the quickfix window to jump to the corresponding posting.

  It is strongly recommended that you add mappings for common quickfix
  commands like `:cprev` and `:cnext`, or that you use T. Pope's Unimpaired
  plugin.

* :`Reconcile`

  Reconcile an account. For example:

	:Reconcile checking

  After you press Enter, you will be asked to enter a target amount (use
  Vim's syntax for numbers, not your ledger's format). For example, for a
  checking account, the target amount may be the balance of your latest bank
  statement. The list of uncleared postings appears in the quickfix window.
  The current balance of the account, together with the difference between the
  target amount and the cleared balance, is shown at the bottom of the screen.
  You may use standard quickfix commands to navigate through the postings. You
  may use |ledger#transaction_state_set()| to update a transaction's state.
  Every time you save your file, the balance and the difference from the
  target amount are updated at the bottom of the screen. The goal, of course,
  is to get such difference to zero. You may press `<C-l>` to refresh the
  Reconcile buffer. To finish reconciling an account, simply close the
  quickfix window.

  There is a highlight group to customize the color of the difference from
  target:

  * `LedgerTarget`

    This is used to color the difference between the target amount and the
    cleared balance.

==============================================================================
SETTINGS                                                     *ledger-settings*

Configuration

Include the following let-statements somewhere in your `.vimrc` to modify the
behaviour of the ledger filetype.

* Path to the `ledger` executable:

	let g:ledger_bin = 'ledger'

* Additional default options for the `ledger` executable:

	let g:ledger_extra_options = ''

* To use a custom external system command to generate a list of account names
  for completion, set the following. If g:ledger_bin is set, this will default
  to running that command with arguments to parse the current file using the
  accounts subcommand (works with ledger or hledger), otherwise it will parse
  the postings in the current file itself.

	let g:ledger_accounts_cmd = 'your_command args'

* To use a custom external system command to generate a list of descriptions
  for completion, set the following. If g:ledger_bin is set, this will default
  to running that command with arguments to parse the current file using the
  descriptions subcommand (works with ledger or hledger), otherwise it will
  parse the transactions in the current file itself.

	let g:ledger_descriptions_cmd = 'your_command args'

* Number of columns that will be used to display the foldtext. Set this when
  you think that the amount is too far off to the right.

        let g:ledger_maxwidth = 80

* String that will be used to fill the space between account name and amount in
  the foldtext. Set this to get some kind of lines or visual aid.

        let g:ledger_fillstring = '    -'

* If you want the account completion to be sorted by level of detail/depth
  instead of alphabetical, include the following line:

        let g:ledger_detailed_first = 1

* By default vim will fold ledger transactions, leaving surrounding blank lines
  unfolded. You can use 'g:ledger_fold_blanks' to hide blank lines following a
  transaction.

        let g:ledger_fold_blanks = 0

  A value of 0 will disable folding of blank lines, 1 will allow folding of a
  single blank line between transactions; any larger value will enable folding
  unconditionally.

  Note that only lines containing no trailing spaces are considered for
  folding. You can take advantage of this to disable this feature on a
  case-by-case basis.

* Decimal separator:

        let g:ledger_decimal_sep = '.'

* Specify at which column decimal separators should be aligned:

        let g:ledger_align_at = 60

* Default commodity used by `ledger#align_amount_at_cursor()`:

        let g:ledger_default_commodity = ''

* Flag that tells whether the commodity should be prepended or appended to the
  amount:

        let g:ledger_commodity_before = 1

* String to be put between the commodity and the amount:

        let g:ledger_commodity_sep = ''

* Flag that enable the spelling of the amount:

        let g:ledger_commodity_spell = 1

* Format of transaction date:

        let g:ledger_date_format = '%Y/%m/%d'

* The file to be used to generate reports:

        let g:ledger_main = '%'

  The default is to use the current file.

* Position of a report buffer:

        let g:ledger_winpos = 'B'

  Use `b` for bottom, `t` for top, `l` for left, `r` for right. Use uppercase letters
  if you want the window to always occupy the full width or height.

* Format of quickfix register reports (see |:Register|):

	let g:ledger_qf_register_format = \
        '%(date) %-50(payee) %-30(account) %15(amount) %15(total)\n'

  The format is specified using the standard Ledger syntax for --format.

* Format of the reconcile quickfix window (see |:Reconcile|):

	let g:ledger_qf_reconcile_format = \
        '%(date) %-4(code) %-50(payee) %-30(account) %15(amount)\n'

  The format is specified using the standard Ledger syntax for --format.

* Flag that tells whether a location list or a quickfix list should be used:

	let g:ledger_use_location_list = 0

  The default is to use the quickfix window. Set to 1 to use a location list.

* Position of the quickfix/location list:

	let g:ledger_qf_vertical = 0

  Set to 1 to open the quickfix window in a vertical split.

* Size of the quickfix window:

	let g:ledger_qf_size = 10

  This is the number of lines of a horizontal quickfix window, or the number
  of columns of a vertical quickfix window.

* Flag to show or hide filenames in the quickfix window:

	let g:ledger_qf_hide_file = 1

  Filenames in the quickfix window are hidden by default. Set this to 1 is
  you want filenames to be visible.

* Text of the output of the |:Balance| command:

	let g:ledger_cleared_string = 'Cleared: '
	let g:ledger_pending_string = 'Cleared or pending: '
	let g:ledger_target_string = 'Difference from target: '

==============================================================================
COMPLETION                                                 *ledger-completion*

Omni completion is currently implemented for account names only.

### Accounts

Account names are matched by the start of every sub-level. When you
insert an account name like this:

    Asse<C-X><C-O>

You will get a list of top-level accounts that start like this.

Go ahead and try something like:

    As:Ban:Che<C-X><C-O>

When you have an account like this, 'Assets:Bank:Checking' should show up.

When you want to complete on a virtual transaction, it's currently best
to keep the cursor in front of the closing bracket. Of course you can
insert the closing bracket after calling the completion, too.
